<h1>The Best Movies According to OREO</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>To all the boys I've loved before</h3>
<p>Lara Jean learns a lot of lessons--she changes and she grows--but she never becomes anything other than herself. It's always her discovering new sides of herself. That's so important for young women to see.</p>
<h3>The kissing booth</h3>
<p>The Kissing Booth deploys every rom-com clich√© in the book with little care given to achieving any real sentiment</p>
<h3>Manjummal boys</h3>
<p>survival thriller cum coming-of-age saga (that) is outstanding in part yet thinly written and inconsistently toned for the most part</p>
